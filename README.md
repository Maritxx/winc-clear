# Clear!
> Clear is a website for badminton trainers. It allows trainers to find new training exercises to keep their training diverse and fun.  
> Live demo of the project can be found [_here_](https://maritxx.github.io/winc-clear/).

## General Information
This project was created as an assignment for Winc Academy. The exact goals of the project can be found [_here_](#assignment-requirements).
I have designed the website using Figma and created different layouts, based on their respective viewpoints (mobile, tablet and desktop). 
The project does not currently have any training exercises listed. This will be added in the future, allowing trainers to publish/add exercises with a CMS.
